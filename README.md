# Adam Rybak - Portfolio

This is my home page which is mainly portfolio for projects and includes some basic information about me. While creating the page I decided to practice some elementary animation techniques which my previous projects lack.

## Built with:

HTML i CSS (flex-box, grid, media queries) <br />
JavaScript <br />
Intersection Observer API <br />
Google fonts <br />
Font awesome

## Functionality:

All page is about navigating throughout a few sections about me. The most interesting function of the project are subtle animations run when certain elements of the page are interescting (e.g. moving headings or menu which changes it color and opacity) thanks to Intersection Observer API.
